I'm going to assume basic familiarity with you're familiar with the basic linear regression block beta1 plus beta 2 X 2 I plus beta 3 X 3 I plus beta to the K X K I plus U I.

You learned about the assumptions that were needed for the estimators of that model the optimal this property called blue that's
linear unbiased estimators.

If it was a two variable case where you just had y equals beta 1 plus beta 2 X 2 I plus U I.

There's some scatter of points out there and what you want to do is to find the best fitting line for these points so you're given a set of data on x and y and given that set of data you want to find the best possible fitting line and you want to know about its properties.

There's two main reasons why we look at these models. One is to test hypotheses to test theories about how the world works. We want to know how money a change in the money supply affects GDP, affects interest rates, effects unemployment.

If you've been paying attention to those, we have competing theories about how that works. presumably we can use tests to discriminate among competing theoretical models and find the ones provide the best fit the best possible explanation for the world and presumably that then help us understand how the world works.

So this group of people uses these models for different purpose and in fact we'll find out later that these people are more or less likely to worry about the forecasters bias. It's possible to have an estimator to have a forecast it's a little bit off it's biased but has a really low variance it's pretty good versus an estimator that's on the button that has a huge variance.

So one might be a little tiny bit off but very close to the truth the other one might be centered on the truth but very high variance.

Forecasters often will choose the biased estimator because it has a narrower forecast error, but academics wouldn't be interested in that at all, because they want to know what is the multiplier and a biased estimate or multiplier is not useful, it doesn't add your knowledge to the world.

So if you want to say well what is the exact truth your mother said using unbiased estimators to learn about what the actual number is rather than these biases.

How do you find the best fitting model well there's three steps involved. The first step is to specify the model I call the specification model.

So far you've probably assumed you had the correct model you did a little bit or omitted variables, a little bit on the inclusion of extraneous variables.

We'll find out if you leave out wage squared you're going to get really really bad estimates. You're not going to learn about the world because you start with a misspecified model.

You might have the perfect model in mind, you have to look for data there so data on but there's something close if I use something close to the true piece of data.
